# 🎓 College Placement Prediction Model

A machine learning-based project that predicts % of a student is likely to be placed based on their academic records and other factors.

---

## 📌 Context

This project started as a learning experiment, where I initially explored model training using basic datasets. Later, I **scaled** it by choosing a richer dataset, **extracted required columns**, and performed proper **EDA and preprocessing**. After training and validating my model, I created a **web application** using Flask to make it interactive and usable.

➡️ For now, I’ve added the **GitHub repo** — and soon the **live web app link** will be available too!
